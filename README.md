## Usage 
* Fork Repo 
* Clone Repo to local machine
* run npm install in local project folder
* run node index.js 
* NOTE: you can add path to a log file on your local machine as third argument when running CLI tool. If no file is added,
  the log.log file will be used to run program

## Warning
*Geo2lite free API only accepts 1000 free requests per day. The log.log file contains 315 logs so you will only be able to run this tool 3 times at that volume. Adjust logs or provide smaller log file if you would like to use tool more often.
